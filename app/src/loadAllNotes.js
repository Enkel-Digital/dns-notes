 * Vuex action to load all notes from API, reset vuex notes to be what the API returned.

 * Only used on login or when first joining an organization where all notes are pulled,
 * instead of pulling all the events and applying them 1 by 1.
 * This helps to speed up processes where there are thousands of changes/events vs hundreds of actual records.
 *
 * This vuex action is in its own module so that it can be lazily loaded,
 * as it is not always used, other than on login and first joining an organization.
